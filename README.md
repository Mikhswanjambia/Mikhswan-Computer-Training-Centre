Mikhswan Hassan Said, also known as Jambia, was born on August 27, 2004, in Kiruku Village, Tanga City, Tanzania. He is the son of Fatuma Jambia Mwamchola, of Tanzanian origin, and Hassan Said Suleiman, of Kenyan origin. Mikhswan began his education journey at a kindergarten in Lungalunga, Kwale County, Kenya. In 2012, he moved to Tanzania and enrolled at Kiruku Primary School, where he completed his primary education. In 2015, he relocated back to Kenya and completed his primary education from grade 4 to 8 in 2022.

After finishing his primary school education, Mikhswan spent a year in Mombasa, Kenya, before returning to Tanzania.

His goal was to provide hands-on skills, especially in the areas of Microsoft Office, operating systems, and networking, to address the growing need for computer literacy in the region.

Mikhswan Computer Training Centre, like many educational institutions, faces several challenges in its journey to provide quality practical computer training. Some of the key problems and challenges encountered by the organization include:

1. Limited Resources: As a growing institution, Mikhswan Computer Training Centre may face constraints in terms of infrastructure, technology, and equipment necessary for effective training. Adequate computers, networking devices, and other training resources are essential for providing the hands-on experience that the center emphasizes.


2. Financial Constraints: Securing sufficient funding to maintain and expand the center’s operations is a common challenge. The institution may need to invest in more training materials, staff, and even marketing efforts to attract students. Limited financial resources can hinder growth and the ability to offer diverse courses or better facilities.


3. Awareness and Enrollment: The center may struggle with creating awareness of its programs and attracting a larger pool of students. In a region with many educational options, getting the word out about the value of practical computer training can be a challenge. Building a solid reputation and attracting new students requires effective marketing and outreach strategies.


4. Competition: Other institutions and training centers offering similar computer programs could present competition. Mikhswan Computer Training Centre needs to differentiate itself by emphasizing its practical, hands-on approach to training and the quality of its courses.


5. Technology Access: In some areas, students may face challenges in accessing the required technology, either because of financial limitations or lack of internet connectivity. This can affect enrollment or completion rates, especially for courses that require online resources or advanced computer systems.


6. Staffing and Training: Ensuring that instructors have the necessary skills and qualifications to teach students effectively can be a challenge. Recruiting skilled trainers who align with the center’s vision of providing practical, hands-on learning is essential but may be difficult in some cases.


7. Cultural and Social Barriers: In some communities, there may be a lack of awareness about the importance of computer literacy or technological skills, which could hinder enrollment. Additionally, financial and social barriers may prevent some individuals from attending the center, especially if their families are unable to afford training fees.


8. Government Regulations and Support: Navigating local regulations, ensuring compliance with education standards, and securing support from local government programs or educational initiatives can be challenging. It requires continuous effort to maintain the necessary paperwork and adhere to any changes in local policies.
Despite these challenges, Mikhswan Hassan Said’s determination and commitment to providing quality education remain key to overcoming these obstacles. The center’s focus on practical, hands-on computer training is a strength that can help it continue to grow and succeed in the face of adversity.
